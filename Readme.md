# Lab 07 - Odd or Even

## Lab Goal
In this lab you will be reading from a file and outputting whether the number read is odd or even.

## Instructions
 * Complete the `main` method. You may write helper methods as needed.
 * The first line of the data file is the number of lines of data following.
 * Each line contains exactly one number.
 * Output a message like "2 is even" or "3 is odd". The test is checking for the presence of the number and "odd" or "even" on the same line.
 * Make sure you add a javadoc comment on each method.  You'll need to include a `@param` tag for each method that accepts a parameter.  Include a `@return` tag on any method that returns a value.

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.
* Edit the first line of the Readme.md file and put your username in both locations that say "username".  This is necessary if you want the badge at the top of the instructions to show red or green based on your most recent commit.

## Grading
* 90 - `main` works.
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
